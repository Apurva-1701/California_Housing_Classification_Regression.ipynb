# California Housing Classification & Regression

This repository contains code for predicting median house values and classifying houses into high/low value categories using neural networks in PyTorch.

## Files:
- `California_Housing_Classification_Regression.ipynb`: Contains the implementation.
- `README.md`: Description of the project.

## Tasks:
- **Regression Task:** Predicting median house values using neural networks.
- **Classification Task:** Categorizing houses into "low value" and "high value."

## Results:

- ** Regression Task: Achieved MSE of 0.7000 and RÂ² score of 0.4658.
- **Classification Task: Accuracy of 83.07%, Precision of 83.67%, Recall of 81.91%, and F1-score of
